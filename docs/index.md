# Hava Provider

This provider allows you to use terraform to manage Sources in Hava.io, making it easy to add and remove cloud environments to your Hava subscription following modern gitops practises.

This provider can be added to your core environment configuration code to automatically add all new environments to Hava for automatic document generation.

## Authentication

Hava uses an API token to authenticate to the API, this can either be passed to the provider directly in terraform using the `api_token` attribute, or by setting an environment variable `HAVA_TOKEN`. 

Setting the attribute directly takes precedence over the environment variable, but using the environment variable is considered more secure as it will not be commited to source control.

Details on how to get an API token can be found in the [Hava developer documentation](https://developer.hava.io/api/authentication).

## Example Usage
```tf
provider "hava" {}

resource "hava_source_aws_car_resource" "example" {
  name = "Example Source"
  role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::12341234:role/HavaRO"
  external_id = "xxx"
}
```
